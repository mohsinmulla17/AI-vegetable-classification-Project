# AI-vegetable-classification-Project
  The "Deep Learning-Based Approach for Vegetable Image Classification" project aims to develop an advanced system capable of accurately identifying and categorizing various types of vegetables using deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image recognition algorithms, the system will analyze input images of vegetables to classify them into predefined categories. By automating the classification process, the project seeks to streamline agricultural operations, improve inventory management in retail settings, and enhance the overall efficiency of vegetable processing industries.
